# Robotic Hand Project
This is the Github repository that contains the code for my 8th grade science fair project. The main python code is contained in one file, `main.py`, and the Arduino microcontroller code is in the `arduino` subdirectory.
I wouldn't reccomend cloning and running this yourself, as it's been built specifically for our hand and won't be of much use otherwise.
